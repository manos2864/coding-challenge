I used create-react-app command to initialize my project.
I haven't installed any open-source dependencies.
I have use only css Modules, custom made css and google fonts, nothing more.

I haven't complete:

1. Checkbox styling
2. Toggle switch
3. Status implementation
4. There is a check all mechanism bug
